# Simple Meshes

A [`mesh`](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/specification/2.0/#reference-mesh) represents a geometric object that appears in a scene. An example of a `mesh` has already been shown in the [minimal glTF file](gltfTutorial_003_MinimalGltfFile.md). This example had a single `mesh` attached to a single `node`, and the mesh consisted of a single [`mesh.primitive`](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/specification/2.0/#reference-primitive) that contained only a single attribute&mdash;namely, the attribute for the vertex positions. But usually, the mesh primitives will contain more attributes. These attributes may, for example, be the vertex normals or texture coordinates.

The following is a glTF asset that contains a simple mesh with multiple attributes, which will serve as the basis for explaining the related concepts:

```javascript
{
  "scenes" : [
    {
      "nodes" : [ 0, 1]
    }
  ],
  "nodes" : [
    {
      "mesh" : 0
    },
    {
      "mesh" : 0,
      "translation" : [ 1.0, 0.0, 0.0 ]
    }
  ],
  
  "meshes" : [
    {
      "primitives" : [ {
        "attributes" : {
          "POSITION" : 1,
          "NORMAL" : 2
        },
        "indices" : 0
      } ]
    }
  ],

  "buffers" : [
    {
      "uri" : "data:application/octet-stream;base64,AAABAAIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIA/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAPwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgD8AAAAAAAAAAAAAgD8AAAAAAAAAAAAAgD8=",
      "byteLength" : 80
    }
  ],
  "bufferViews" : [
    {
      "buffer" : 0,
      "byteOffset" : 0,
      "byteLength" : 6,
      "target" : 34963
    },
    {
      "buffer" : 0,
      "byteOffset" : 8,
      "byteLength" : 72,
      "target" : 34962
    }
  ],
  "accessors" : [
    {
      "bufferView" : 0,
      "byteOffset" : 0,
      "componentType" : 5123,
      "count" : 3,
      "type" : "SCALAR",
      "max" : [ 2 ],
      "min" : [ 0 ]
    },
    {
      "bufferView" : 1,
      "byteOffset" : 0,
      "componentType" : 5126,
      "count" : 3,
      "type" : "VEC3",
      "max" : [ 1.0, 1.0, 0.0 ],
      "min" : [ 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 ]
    },
    {
      "bufferView" : 1,
      "byteOffset" : 36,
      "componentType" : 5126,
      "count" : 3,
      "type" : "VEC3",
      "max" : [ 0.0, 0.0, 1.0 ],
      "min" : [ 0.0, 0.0, 1.0 ]
    }
  ],
  
  "asset" : {
    "version" : "2.0"
  }
}
```

Image 8a shows the rendered glTF asset.

## The mesh definition

The given example still contains a single mesh that has a single mesh primitive. But this mesh primitive contains multiple attributes:

```javascript
  "meshes" : [
    {
      "primitives" : [ {
        "attributes" : {
          "POSITION" : 1,
          "NORMAL" : 2
        },
        "indices" : 0
      } ]
    }
  ],
```

In addition to the `"POSITION"` attribute, it has a `"NORMAL"` attribute. This refers to the `accessor` object that provides the vertex normals, as described in the [Buffers, BufferViews, and Accessors](gltfTutorial_005_BuffersBufferViewsAccessors.md) section.


## The rendered mesh instances

As can be seen in Image 8a, the mesh is rendered *twice*. This is accomplished by attaching the mesh to two different nodes:

```javascript
  "nodes" : [
    {
      "mesh" : 0
    },
    {
      "mesh" : 0,
      "translation" : [ 1.0, 0.0, 0.0 ]
    }
  ],
```

The `mesh` property of each node refers to the mesh that is attached to the node, using the index of the mesh. One of the nodes has a `translation` that causes the attached mesh to be rendered at a different position. 

The [next section](gltfTutorial_009_Meshes.md) will explain meshes and mesh primitives in more detail.
